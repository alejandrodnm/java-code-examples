# Java code examples

This is a collection of code examples for different topics.

- **Design patterns**: in almost all the examples static classes were used to
  keep all the code in on file. Almost all the examples were taken from
  [here][dessignPatterns1] and [here][dessignPatterns2].

- **Concurrency**: basically examples from [baeldung][baeldungConcurrency].

- **Database**: using [HikariCP][hikari] with [jooq][jooq] and testing with
  [jUnit5][junit5] and [testcontainers][testcontainers].

- **Http**: using the java `HttpClient` and testing with
  [mock-server][mockserver].

- **Streams**: mostly a map reduce example.
